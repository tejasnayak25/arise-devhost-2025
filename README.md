# AI-Powered Carbon Compliance & ESG Reporting Automation 
## Problem Statement: 
Across the Nordic region, companies are under increasing pressure from both 
EU and national regulations to 
report and reduce their carbon footprint. The upcoming **EU Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) and EU Taxonomy rules** require organizations of all sizes to produce 
transparent **ESG** (Environmental, Social, Governance) data. 
However, many businesses — especially in construction, manufacturing, and 
energy sectors — rely on manual spreadsheets and inconsistent data 
collection from invoices, sensors, and energy systems. This results in 
inaccurate, late, or non-compliant ESG reports.\
The problem is further amplified by data fragmentation, where carbon 
information is stored in different systems (ERP, utility bills, energy meters) that 
don’t communicate. Companies risk financial penalties, reputation loss, 
and missed green financing opportunities due to non-compliance. 
There’s a critical need for an automated, intelligent system to simplify ESG 
reporting and help Nordic companies track and reduce emissions proactively.
